# Makefile Templates

## Introduction

Here are some **Makefile Templates** for different size of projects, from a simple project which has a 'flat' source file structure, to a bigger project which has a 'complex' structure.

These templates may not be clear enough or concise, but they are built for specific scenes. Some of them may have severe side-effect when the project grows, but that shoud be the time to consider changing a better Makefile from other templates we provided.

Feel free to raise issues, or contribute pull-requests, we welcome all kinds of ideas.
